    Define a neural network that performs binary classification.
    The network should accept your number of features as input, and produce

    Notes on training:
    To train a binary classifier in PyTorch, use BCELoss.
    BCELoss is binary cross entropy loss, documentation: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.BCELoss
